# Archived Documentation

This directory contains previous versions of documentation that have been consolidated, superseded, or are no longer relevant to the current deployment.

## Security Documentation (Archived December 8, 2025)

The following security documents have been **consolidated into a single comprehensive document**: [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md)

### Archived Files:

1. **SECURITY_AUDIT.md** (Dec 5, 2025)
   - Original security audit identifying critical vulnerabilities
   - Phase 1 fixes documented

2. **SECURITY_AUDIT_2025-12-06.md** (Dec 6, 2025)
   - Post-Workers migration security status
   - Phase 1 & 2 completion documented

3. **SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md** (Dec 6, 2025)
   - Detailed implementation guide for security features
   - Middleware architecture documentation

4. **SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md** (Dec 6, 2025)
   - Production endpoint hardening documentation
   - Management endpoint disabling details

### Why Consolidated?

These four documents contained overlapping information and made it difficult to find the current security status. They have been merged into a single, comprehensive security documentation file.

**For current security information**, refer to: [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md)

## Optimization Implementation Notes (Archived December 8, 2025)

The following documents were development notes created during the optimization implementation. All details have been **integrated into comprehensive documentation**: [`../CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_OPTIMIZATION.md`](../CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_OPTIMIZATION.md) and [`../HYBRID_LLM_STRATEGY.md`](../HYBRID_LLM_STRATEGY.md)

### Archived Files:

5. **DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md** (Dec 7, 2025)
   - Database optimization details (composite indexes, IOC deduplication)
   - Covered comprehensively in CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_OPTIMIZATION.md §7

6. **MULTI_SIGNAL_SIMILARITY.md** (Dec 7, 2025)
   - Multi-signal similarity scoring implementation details
   - Covered comprehensively in CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_OPTIMIZATION.md §8

7. **TRI_MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** (Dec 7, 2025)
   - Tri-model AI optimization implementation notes
   - Covered comprehensively in CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_OPTIMIZATION.md and HYBRID_LLM_STRATEGY.md

### Why Archived?

These were working notes created during implementation. All relevant information has been incorporated into the comprehensive optimization documentation, making these standalone documents redundant.

**For current optimization information**, refer to:
- [`../CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_OPTIMIZATION.md`](../CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_OPTIMIZATION.md) - Main optimization guide
- [`../HYBRID_LLM_STRATEGY.md`](../HYBRID_LLM_STRATEGY.md) - AI model strategy details
